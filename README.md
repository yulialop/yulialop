## About me

My name is Yulia, and I’m an experienced Business Intelligence Analyst with a background in finance and operations and a master’s degree in Business Analytics. 

Passionate about data, I enjoy developing analytical solutions that turn complex data into clear, actionable insights, whether for a personal problem, such as creating a workout-tracker dashboard to support decision-making around workload planning and performance optimisation, or in a professional context, synthesising complex data to identify key drivers, anomalies, and emerging patterns in operational and financial performance. My projects include time-series forecasting, machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), regression analysis, clustering techniques, simulation, optimisation, and data visualisation.

My tech stack include Python, R, SQL, Excel (VBA, Power Query, Solver, pivot tables, macros), Markdown, Git, IBM Cognos Analytics, Power BI, and Tableau.
