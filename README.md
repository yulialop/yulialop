My name is Yulia, and I’m an experienced Business Intelligence Analyst with a background in finance and operations and a master’s degree in Business Analytics. 

I am interested in Data Science and enjoy developing analytical solutions that transform complex information into clear and actionable insight. My projects involve time-series forecasting, machine learning, NLP, regression, clustering, optimisation, and data visualisation. 

My technical toolkit includes Python, R, SQL, Microsoft Excel (Solver, VBA), Power BI, and Tableau.
